# Performance testing framework
This framework could be used for backend load testing with Gatling load-tool and Lighthouse for web UI performance testing.
With Grafana open-source visualisation solution you can retrieve real-time metrics for Gatling tests and Prometheus host resources monitoring.

## Getting Started

Framework consists of next services:
- **Grafana**: data visualization & monitoring
- **Influxdb**: time series DB platform for metrics & events (Time Series Data)
- **Jenkins**: continuous integration server for tests execution
- **Gatling**: tool for backend load testing
- **Lighthouse**: tool for web UI performance testing
- **Prometheus**: time series DB platform for storing Host (Docker) metrics. Depends on:
- **cAdvisor**: analyzes and exposes resource usage and performance data from running containers

## Prerequisites

To run framework install docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

You should be able to run ```docker run hello-world``` with no errors.

## Installing

1. Clone this repository
   ```git clone https://github.com/yevle/gatling-performance-infra.git```
2. open gatling-performance-infra dir

3. ```docker-compose up --build -d```

All containers should be up and running

### Services endpoints
- **jenkins** localhost:8181
- **grafana** localhost:8857
- **influxdb** localhost:8653
- **prometheus** localhost:9091
- **cadvisor** localhost:8081

## Jenkins

Login to Jenkins with admin/admin(could be changed in docker-compose file).
By default, jenkins consists of 3 jobs:
- **GatlingBackend**: runs Gatling simulation with only parameter: -SIMULATION, to set simulation class name.
- **GatlingBackendParam**: runs Gatling simulation with runtime parameters: -SIMULATION -USERS -RAMPUP -DURATION
- **Lighthouse**: runs load simulation on defined web service

## Making your gatling script compatible with framework

Framework accept both .java and .scala versions of scripts. For default GatlingBackendParam job you can add next runtime parameters:
- -USERS
- -RAMPUP
- -DURATION

Before project building, you need to place simulation files in named directory inside 'gatling/simulations/' folder. Also all needed resources should be placed inside 'gatling/resources/' folder.

## Running scenario with GatlingBackendParam job

To run Gatling demo script: 
**Open GatlingBackendParam job -> Build with Parameters -> Set simulation file name (<<folder>>.<<filename.scala>>) -> Set build parameters  -> Build**

This job will start Gatling docker container and execute defined Gatling load simulation.

You'll find default test reports inside **Gatling** tab in Jenkins job page: 
http://localhost:8181/job/GatlingBackend/gatling/ 

Also you'll be able to retrieve real-time and post-run metrics on Grafana dashboard. 
Runtime metrics link is available in job description as well as post-run link will be attached to every runs description on finish.

## Grafana

### Available Gatling metrics

**Gatling Report Metrics** dashboard has multiple rows with different metrics:
- Table: Overall statistics for each request (Total requests count; OK and KO statuses count; Max / Min / Mean response time and percentiles; Std deviation). 
- Graph: Responses Status over Active Users (Shows count of OK/KO responses as well as users count each second)
- Graph: Requests Response Time (Shows changes in Min/Max/Mean response timings)
- Table: Errors (List of requests error messages)

### Prometheus Metrics
Real time host performance metrics should be available in **Docker monitoring with service selection** dashboard.
Dashboard contains visualizations based on data from prometheus.
You can login to Grafana with admin/admin and edit any dashboard.

### Timerange

All values in visualizations are calculated according to selected time range. Default timerange is last 5 min with 5 sec refresh. Timerange could be set in timepicker or selected on any graph.

### Templating

Graphs and series on dashboard are displayed dynamically according to variables selected:
- On "Gatling Report Metrics" dashboard there "simulation" and "request" variable to choose which simulation metrics to show and which specific requests details.
- On "Docker monitoring..." dashboard you can choose service (container) variable for its stats to show.
